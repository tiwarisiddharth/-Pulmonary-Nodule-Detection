Hybrid Preprocessing Using Bilateral Filter and Area based Contouring for Pulmonary Nodule Detection


Detection of pulmonary nodules from CT scan using hybrid preprocessing by Bilateral Filter removes the noise and blurs the image while keeping the edges sharp. Then finding all the contours and showing only those which are larger than a specified size since all nodule exist with size of diameter (5-30mm).

Using such method for detection of pulmonary nodules at early stages helps cancer patient and researchers s well.
